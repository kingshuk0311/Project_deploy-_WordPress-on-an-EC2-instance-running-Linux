STEPS:
-------

1.Write the Ansible playbook (deploy_wordpress.yml)
2.Write the Dockerfile
3.RUN COMMANDS:
-----------------------------
(a).Build the Docker image by running the following command in the repository directory:
   
    docker build -t ansible-wordpress .

(b).Once the image is built, you can run the Ansible playbook inside a Docker container using the following command:

    docker run -it --rm ansible-wordpress





Output - This command will start the Docker container, execute the Ansible playbook, and add a random post to the WordPress site every hour.

Note - Variables in the Ansible playbook need to match your specific setup of AWS account.
